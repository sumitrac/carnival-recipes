Servings: 8
Time: 1 hour 15 minutes

Ingredients:
Time: 1 hour 15 minutes

2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
Pinch ground nutmeg
3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups grated sharp Cheddar
1/2 pound dried rotini pasta
Olive oil cooking spray
6 slices thick-cut good quality bacon
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
3. Drain and spray with olive oil cooking spray, making sure the noodles are coated well. Set aside.
4. In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until crispy. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate.
6. Season the vegetables with salt and pepper and saute until the onions wilt and become translucent, about 4 minutes.
7. Reduce the heat to medium-low and sprinkle in the flour, stirring to coat the onions and garlic.

8. Continue to cook until you have a blond roux, about 5 minutes.
10. Crumble the bacon and add half to the sauce. Mix in the Cheddar and mozzarella.
11. Turn the heat to low. Add the pasta to the cheese sauce and stir to coat. Cover and keep warm.
12. In a small bowl, add the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, chives and olive oil.
